> Use the storage directory to get the values. Like "/storage/emulated/0/config.json" without any quotation. I still don't know if the keys are case sensitive, but make sure that the json configuration format (keys) must be same as what you see.

There are still unknown errors for this project, if you want to help me to debug, kindly give us your negative feedback thru the feedback section of the app.
